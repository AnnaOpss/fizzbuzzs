# fizzbuzzs
This is a collection of implementations for the fizzbuzz or cracklepop algorithm.

Each source contains a readable and simple implementation and some terrible, almost unreadable versions of the same solution.

This is nothing more than a code exercise.

The fizzbuzz algorithm is described [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz).
