# fizzbuzzs
This is a collection of implementations for the fizzbuzz or cracklepop algorithm.

Each source contains a readable and simple implementation and a terrible, almost unreadable version of the same solution.

The fizzbuzz algorithm is described [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fizz_buzz).
